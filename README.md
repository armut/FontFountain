# *Font Fountain*

### A desktop tool for choosing fonts.

This little program allows users to view system fonts and preview them with sample text. 

![The preview window.](/ss/main_window.png?raw=true)

Font selector dialog:

![Font selector.](/ss/selector.png?raw=true)

It is also possible to change the text area's background color and font's fore color in preview:

![Changing back and fore colors.](/ss/color_choosing.png?raw=true)

Color chooser dialog:

![Background color chooser.](/ss/bg_chooser.png?raw=true)

Scrolling the mouse wheel up will increase the font size and scrolling down will decrease it:

![Changing size with scrolling the mouse wheel.](/ss/huge.png?raw=true)

One useful feature in this tool is that you can preview a ttf font which is not installed in the system by browsing it from your disk:

![Opening a ttf font which is not installed on the system.](/ss/open.png?raw=true)

Other than the above, this program uses Swing for the GUI and I tried to make a tiny and good-looking windows and dialogs. 
These window related codes are in the *fenestra* package.

Fonts used in the screenshots are [Fipps](http://www.fontspace.com/pheist/fipps) and [File](http://www.fontfabric.com/file-free-font/) respectively.

I hope you enjoy!
